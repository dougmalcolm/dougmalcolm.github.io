## Executive Summary
### Overview:
What makes a pinball player great? This analysis looks to answer that quesion by uncovering patterns in pinball tournament player data.

In this project I... 
1. Developed a **Python web scraper** to extract player data from the [IFPA Pinball Website](https://www.ifpapinball.com/).
2. Performed data cleaning and preprocessing using the **pandas** library.
3. Built **data visualization graphs** to help make sense of the data.
4. Employed the **machine learning** sklearn library to construct and refine linear regression models.
5. Conducted a thorough analysis to interpret the finalized model and derive **meaningful conclusions**.
