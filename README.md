## Executive Summary
### Overview:
What makes a pinball player great? This analysis looks to answer that quesion by uncovering patterns in pinball tournament player data.
I developed a Python web scraper to extract player data from the IFPA pinball website [LINK HERE]. I then performed data cleaning and preprocessing using the pandas library. Employing the machine learning sklearn library, I constructed and refined linear regression models. Finally, I conducted a thorough analysis to interpret the finalized model and derive meaningful conclusions.
