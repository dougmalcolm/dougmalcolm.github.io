## Overview
What makes a pinball player great? 
This analysis looks to answer that quesion by uncovering patterns in pinball tournament player data.

In this project I... 
- Developed a **Python web scraper** to extract player data from the [IFPA Pinball Website](https://www.ifpapinball.com/).
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing using the **pandas** library.
- Built **data visualization graphs** to help make sense of the data.
- Employed the **machine learning** sklearn library to construct and refine linear regression models.
- Conducted a thorough analysis to interpret the finalized model and derive **meaningful conclusions**.
