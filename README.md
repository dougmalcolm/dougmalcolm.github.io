## Executive Summary
### Overview:
What makes a pinball player great? This analysis looks to answer that quesion by uncovering patterns in pinball tournament player data.

In this project I... 
- Developed a **Python web scraper** to extract player data from the IFPA pinball website [LINK HERE].
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing using the **pandas library**.
- Employed the **machine learning sklearn** library to construct and refine linear regression models.
- Conducted a thorough analysis to interpret the finalized model and derive **meaningful conclusions**.
